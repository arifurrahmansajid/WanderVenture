## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy the build output to any static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting):

```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy the contents of 'dist/' as instructed by your host
```

_Example: For Netlify_

- Push your code to GitHub
- Connect your repository to Netlify
- Set the build command to `npm run build`
- Set the publish directory to `dist`
- Deploy!

_Example: For Firebase Hosting_

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

Ensure your hosting provider is configured for single-page apps if using React Router.
